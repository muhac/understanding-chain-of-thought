# Towards Understanding Chain-of-Thought Prompting: An Empirical Study of What Matters

Code, model input/output and cached evaluation results for our [ACL-23](https://2023.aclweb.org/) paper ["Towards Understanding Chain-of-Thought Prompting: An Empirical Study of What Matters"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10001) by [Boshi Wang](https://boshi-wang.github.io/), [Sewon Min](https://shmsw25.github.io/), [Xiang Deng](https://xiang-deng.github.io/), [Jiaming Shen](https://mickeysjm.github.io/), [You Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i8TKyfIAAAAJ&hl=en), [Luke Zettlemoyer](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/lsz) and [Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/).


## Overview

While [Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) can improve reasoning in large LMs, there is little understanding of what makes it effective. We perform a series of ablation studies on two representive benchmarks where CoT brings large improvements, which reveal the impact of different aspects of CoT demonstrations. We find that 
- CoT reasoning is possible with invalid demonstrations - prompting with invalid reasoning steps can achieve over 80-90% of the performance obtained using CoT under various metrics, while still generating coherent lines of reasoning during inference.
- Other aspects of the rationales, such as being relevant to the query and correctly ordering the reasoning steps, are much more important for effective CoT reasoning.

Overall, these findings open up new questions regarding LLMs' capability to learn to reason in context, and reflections on benchmarking few-shot reasoning.

## Usage
First put your OpenAI API key in a file named ```api_key.txt```.

### Run LLM generation
Details could be found in the param descriptions in ```main_*.py```. For example, to run the invalid reasoning setting on GSM8K and Bamboogle:
```bash
python main_gsm8k.py --prompt_dir prompts_arithmetic/invalid_reasoning.txt --eng gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct --num_test 800 --seed 1357 --temp 0.0 --test_ind indices_800.json
```
```bash
python main_bamboogle.py --prompt_dir prompts_bamboogle/invalid_reasoning.txt --eng gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct --num_test -1 --seed 1357 --temp 0.0
```

### Evaluation
```eval_*.ipynb``` contains the scripts and cached evaluation results.
